58	EGFR T790M	34	Lung Cancer	1324		Multikinase Inhibitor AEE788,Gefitinib	Sequential	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	PubMed		Yun et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

84	ALK EML4::ALK AND ALK G1269A	4312	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Resistance	This study analyzed patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were positive for EML4-ALK fusions (ALK+) and progressed on crizotinib monotherapy. One ALK+ patient harbored the common E6;A20 fusion with ALK G1269A co-mutation in post-crizotinib progression biopsies. The presence of ALK G1269A pre-crizotinib could not be evaluated. This patient was a 21 year old non-smoking male with adenocarcinoma, wt for KRAS and EGFR, negative for ALK copy number gain, who experienced crizotinib as a 2nd line therapy. The patient's best response on crizotinib was stable disease (377 days on treatment). In vitro, Ba/F3 cell line expressing EML4-ALK fusion (E6a;A20, a known sensitizing alteration) and ALK G1269A co-mutation demonstrated resistance to crizotinib treatment (341 nmol/L vs. 22 nmol/L) compared to Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK fusion. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and colony formation. Levels of phosphorylation of ALK, ERK, STAT3, and AKT were higher in ALK+ G1269A mutant cells than ALK+ controls, by western blot. The authors note that ALK G1269A likely induces resistance by preventing crizotinib from accessing its binding pocket in the ALK kinase domain.	22235099	PubMed		Doebele et al., 2012, Clin.

148	KRAS Mutation	332	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		MEK Inhibitor RO4987655		Predictive	Does Not Support	B	Resistance	This was a phase I expansion and pharmacodynamic study of oral MEK inhibitor RO4987655 on advanced cancer. Of 18 patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 10 experienced clinical benefit: 2 partial responses and 8 patients experiencing stable disease for longer than 8 weeks. The median days on treatment was 58.5 (13-394) with one patient ongoing treatment at the end of the study period (56 weeks). The response rate of patients with KRAS mutant NSCLC was 11%, and 71% showed decrease in metabolic response (less FDG uptake in FDG-PET analysis). All responders showed decreases in FDG-uptake. There was not a significant decrease in Ki67 expression between day 1 and day 15 of treatment. Authors conclude that RO4987655 has some clinical activity in KRAS mutated NSCLC, though patients with KRAS wild-type NSCLC were excluded from this expansion study, so it is not possible to determine whether activity of RO4987655 in NSCLC is related to KRAS mutation status.	24947927	PubMed		Zimmer et al., 2014, Clin.

HER2 positivity was broadly defined as IHC2+/3+, positive by FISH, or increased circulating HER2 extracellular domain.  Significant differences between the treatment arms were not observed, but in a small subset of IHC3+/FISH positive patients, 5 of 6 responded to trastuzumab and had increased PFS of 8.5 months in comparison to 6.1 months in the IHC2+ group.  Although from 2004, this study remains cited in 2016 literature when discussing the unclear efficacy of trastuzumab in wild-type HER2 overexpressing NSCLC. The authors conclude that future studies of trastuzumab in HER2 positive NSCLC should focus on high expressing subjects.	14679114	PubMed		Gatzemeier et al., 2004, Ann.

The authors report that due to the limited clinical activity of trastuzumab-based therapy in this cohort, as well as similar results in other trastuzumab studies, that targets other than HER2 in NSCLC should be considered for future study.  This 2004 study remains cited in 2016 literature in discussing the unclear efficacy of trastuzumab in wild-type HER2 overexpressing NSCLC, but mutant HER2 in NSCLC has been further studied and a picture of different HER2 mutations being potentially responsive to specific targeted therapies is emerging.	14967075	PubMed		Lara et al., 2004, Clin Lung Cancer		3	accepted	1042	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1042	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false	lung

All tumors were adenocarcinoma with in-frame HER2 exon 20 insertions.  In patients (n=57) that had been treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, an overall response rate of 75% and progression free survival of 5.1 months were observed.  No standard of care currently exists for HER2-mutant NSCLC.  While trastuzumab has not shown clear benefit yet in wild-type HER2 overexpressed NSCLC, the authors conclude that further prospective studies should be done with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in advanced HER2 mutant NSCLC, and that trastuzumab plus chemotherapy should be considered in current treatment courses of this cancer type.	26598547	PubMed		Mazières et al., 2016, Ann.

In the first case, a 50 pack-year patient showed intense non-mutant HER2 expression by IHC without DNA amplification, and had undergone multiple prior lines of treatment.  With induction of trastuzumab and irinotecan treatment, tumor regression was observed with progression free survival of 4.5 months.  Case 2 involved a 68 year old never-smoker with relapsed SCLC.  Tumor showed HER2 positive SCLC cells with no amplification or mutation.  Third line trastuzumab plus irinotecan brought about some symptom improvement and PFS of 3.5 months.  While the efficacy of trastuzumab against NSCLC with elevated levels of wild-type HER2 expression remains unclear, the authors conclude that trastuzumab based therapy is a promising strategy for chemo-resistant SCLC.	25601188	PubMed		Kinehara et al., 2015, Lung Cancer		4	accepted	1044	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1044	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false	lung

Induction of mutant HER2 in these mice drove rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors, where tumor maintenance was dependent on continued YMVA HER2 induction by doxycycline.  Administration of afatinib had a stronger effect than erlotinib or trastuzumab, as measured by histology and tumor volume regression.  Authors state that in the case of afatinib vs. trastuzumab, intracellular HER2 signaling may be blocked by afatanib but remain unaltered by trastuzumab.	19122144	PubMed		Perera et al., 2009, Proc.

186	ALK EML4::ALK	5	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		WHI-P154		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci.  Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	17625570	PubMed		Soda et al., 2007, Nature		5	accepted	1188	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1188	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5	false	lung

This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.	18927303	PubMed		Takeuchi et al., 2008, Clin.

Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.

While all constructs rendered Ba/F3 cells IL3-independant, marked differences in sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib were observed, where v2 was most sensitized to growth inhibition and v3a the least, with v1 and v3b intermediate.  While phospho-ALK western blots indicated that the ALK inhibitors acted similarly on both v2 and v3a EML4-ALK variants, blots of cyclohexamide-treated cells showed that v2 had a shorter half-life than 3a in the transduced cells, potentially explaining increased v2 sensitivity.  Assays with a panel of mutated EML4-ALK variants of varied length suggested that longer EML4-ALK variants are less stable in cells, although this tendency was not observed across other types of ALK fusion.	22912387	PubMed		Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin.

IPI-504 treatment caused regression of H3122 tumors in nude mice, whereas Hsp90 inhibitors usually only cause growth inhibition in these models.  Combined treatment of these mice with IPI-504 and crizotinib caused an even stronger tumor regression.	21258415	PubMed		Normant et al., 2011, Oncogene		4	accepted	1203	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:24 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1203	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/5	false	lung

Transduction of Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK variant 2 (EML4 exon 20 fused to ALK exon 20) caused the cells to grow independently of IL3 addition.  EML4-ALK may be a client protein of Hsp90. Addition of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG to the EML4-ALK variant 2 cells induced cell death which was rescued at lower 17-DMAG concentrations by IL3 addition. This result suggests that 17-DMAG specifically  targeted the EML4-ALK driver in these cells. Finally, 17-DMAG and crizotinib showed a synergistic effect in killing EML4-ALK variant 2 cells.	22912387	PubMed		Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin.

While incubation of Ba/F3 cells transduced with EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2 with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, Ba/F3 cells with variant 3a were not sensitized to 17-DMAG induced death, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation. This in turn suggests that variant 3a may not rely on Hsp90 for stability in cancer cells to the extent of other variants.	22912387	PubMed		Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin.

Incubation of EML4-ALK variant 1 transduced Ba/F3 cells with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-DMAG caused cell death that was reversible with IL3 addition, suggesting that 17-DMAG was effecting the EML4-ALK driver of IL3-independant proliferation, and that EML4-ALK variant 1 is a client protein of Hsp90. The degree of Hsp90 dependence, and targetability of EML4-ALK for Hsp90 inhibition, may vary among ALK fusion variants.  Addition of crizotinib to 17-DMAG caused synergistic death effects, suggesting potential clinical benefit for this inhibitor combination in targeting EML4-ALK variant 1.	22912387	PubMed		Heuckmann et al., 2012, Clin.

Where most clinical trials only admit patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Performance status (PS) of 0 or 1, this patient had PS 4 due to respiratory failure, multiple bone metastases and complications from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Administration of alectinib at 300 mg twice daily was followed by marked improvement seen in tests associated with DIC, pulmonary metastasis and change in PS from 4 to 0. Further improvements after a couple of months suggested a rapid complete response. Alectinib was well tolerated in this first line treatment of a critically ill ALK-positive NSCLC patient.	26938871	PubMed		Yoshida et al., 2016, Anticancer Drugs		3	accepted	1273	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:34 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1273	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/495	false	lung

ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), ten were assessable, and there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.	25153538	PubMed		Gadgeel et al., 2014, Lancet Oncol.

Introduction of this polymorphism in a previously EGFR-inhibitor sensitive cell line led to TKI-resistance. In 141 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, the presence of the polymorphism (N=26) was predictive of a significantly shorter PFS under treatment with EGFR-TKI (6.6 months vs. 11.9 months, p = 0.0027).

The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from this patient, and this cell line was resistant to alectinib. Sequencing of MGH056-1 cells revealed the I1171T mutation in ALK. In cell culture studies Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK I1171T required more that 10x the concentration of alectinib to significantly reduce viability that was required for EML4-ALK wild-type expressing cells. Computer simulation studies indicated that the I1171T mutation interfered with alectinib binding at the ALK active site.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

The ALK kinase domain mutation V1180L was found in these cells, and Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK  V1180L were highly resistant to alectinib. Simulations indicated that the V1180L mutation interfered with alectinib binding. The V1180L mutation was found to be more resistant to alectinib than the I1171T mutation found in an ALK-positive NSCLC patient who developed alectinib resistance on lower dose alectinib  (300mg twice daily).	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

MGH056-1 cells were resistant to crizotinib (IC50 236nmol/L; aproximately 50x higher than for ceritinib). About 50 fold higher concentration of crizotinib was required to inhibit Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4 ALK I1171T than was required for EML4 ALK wild-type.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

Molecular characterization of H3122 CHR-A1 revealed a V1180L ALK kinase domain mutation. The H3122 CHR-A1 cell line required approximately 10 fold increase in crizotinib concentration to induce similar levels of cell death to H3122. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered Ba/F3 cells moderately less susceptible to crizotinib than ectopic EML4-ALK.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

A V1180L missense mutation was found in the kinase domain of ALK in H3122 CHR-A1 cells. Both H3122 and H3122 CHR-A1 cells were highly and equally sensitive to ceritinib induced death. In Ba/F3 cells, ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L rendered cells significantly more sensitive to ceritinib than Ba/F3 containing EML4-ALK I1171T mutant (alectinib and crizotinib resistant) or EML4-ALK wt.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

This cell line is a model for gain of alectinib resistance, and also shows resistance to crizotinib. On the other hand, the often used tool ALK inhibitor TAE684 was highly effective in killing H3122 CHR-A1, where H3122 cells were only slightly more sensitized to TAE684-induced cell death. Ectopic expression of EML4-ALK V1180L in Ba/F3 cells caused IL3 independent growth as well as marked sensitization to TAE684, to a level greater than that seen in EML4-ALK I1171T (alectinib resistance mutation) or EML4-ALK wt, and over 1000x greater sensitivity than unaltered Ba/F3 + IL3.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

Among thirty-six patients that received treatment with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab because of a HER2 mutation (without amplification/overexpression) four patients (11%; 95% CI, 3% to 26%) had objective responses.  Fourteen of the 36 patients with HER2-mutated tumors had NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, n = 13; adenosquamous, n = 1); in this group, three patients (21%; 95% CI, 5% to 51%) had PR and three had SD > 120 days.

Unexpectedly, RASA1 truncating mutations had a strong tendency to co-occur with NF1 truncating mutations (p<0.001). While growth of cell lines with inactivation of only one of these two RasGAPs showed moderate and variable sensitivity to inhibitors of MEK or PI3K, cells with concurrent RASA1/NF1 mutations were profoundly more sensitive (IC50: 0.040μM trametinib).	29127119	PubMed		Hayashi et al., 2018, Clin.

Patients were pretreated with at least one chemotherapy regimen, but no tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the subgroup of 156 patients with exon 19 deletions as their sole EGFR mutation, 83 and 78 were treated with erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively. Objective response (defined as complete + partial response) was approximately 65 percent for both erlotinib gefitinib and non significantly different  (p= .965). Disease control rate (defined as complete response + partial response + stable disease) was 91.6 and 83.3 percent for erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively (p=.113). The study was unable to demonstrate statistical noninferiority via the planned end point; however, the lack of statistically significant differences between erlotinib and gefitinib responses, and the milder adverse effects experienced by gefitinib treated patients, led the authors to conclude that gefitinib is a feasible alternative to erlotinib in treating patients with ex19del EGFR positive, advanced lung adenocarcinoma.	27022112	PubMed		Urata et al., 2016, J.

477	ABL1 R351W	1564	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In this in vitro study, the H1915 non-small cell lung cancer cell line (homozygous for a R351W mutation) was shown to be susceptible to imatinib. This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.	26758680	PubMed		Testoni et al., 2016, EMBO Mol Med		5	accepted	6376	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:47 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6376	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/1564	false	lung

Authors suggest it is a passenger mutation.	27478040	PubMed		Berger et al., 2016, Cancer Cell		3	accepted	11148	Somatic	2023-03-09 17:56:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/11148	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4339	false	lung

In this randomized 3 arm phase II study (CHER-LOB), patients received (A) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, (B) chemotherapy plus lapatinib, or (C) chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and lapatinib, with pathologic complete response (pCR) as endpoint.  From 121 patients, pCR rates were 25% in arm A, 26.3% in arm B, and 46.7% in arm C.

Patients had HER2 positive non-metastatic operable BC. The primary endpoint was disease free survival.  First results report that after median 4.5 year follow up, a non significant 16% improvement in DFS was seen in trastuzumab + lapatinib vs. trastuzumab alone.

Benefit was seen in 30% of 40 patients assigned to afatinib alone, 34.2% of 38 assigned to afatinib plus vinorelbine, and 41.9% of 43 assigned to investigator's treatment choice.  Differences were not statistically significant, and afatanib patients experienced more adverse effects.  While Afatanib did show response in HER2 breast cancer patients, it was not better than investigator's treatment choice and the investigators state that no further development of afatinib for HER2 breast cancer will be planned.	26596672	PubMed		Cortés et al., 2015, Lancet Oncol.

It was thought that the wider range of ErbB family blocking and irreversible properties of afatinib could be beneficial in trastuzumab resistant cancer cells, since ErbB family members are thought to play a role in trastuzumab resistance. Primary endpoint was intention-to-treat group PFS. 339 patients were assigned to afatanib + vinorelbine and 169  to trastuzumab + vinorelbine.  Recruitment was stopped prematurely when it was deemed unlikely that the increased PFS would be seen in the afatinib group. Median PFS was 5.5 months in the afatinib group and 5.6 months in the trastuzumab group.  Afatanib plus vinorelbine was less well tolerated than trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, and the authors conclude that trastuzumab remains the best choice for treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC.	26822398	PubMed		Harbeck et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.

90	ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Trastuzumab,Afatinib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	Trastuzumab resistance is thought to consist of multiple compensatory mechanisms involving ErbB family members such as increased signaling through ErbB family heterodimers.  The irreversible TKI afatinib blocks EGFR, HER2, ErbB3 and ErbB4.  Thus afatinib was studied in this Phase I trial of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 positive metastatic BC (MBC) in combination with continued trastuzumab treatment, where trastuzumab is still the perferred treatment for trastuzumab-progressed MBC.  Objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%.  The authors conclude that the clinical activity observed in this trial warrants further work with afatinib and trastuzumab combination therapy.	25370464	PubMed		Ring et al., 2015, Clin.

109	ERBB2 Amplification	302	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Trastuzumab Emtansine		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	The EMILIA study (NCT00829166) was a Phase II trial to assess the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, n=495) in comparison to lapatinib plus capecitabine (n=496), in treatment of advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.  Patients were required to have progressed on or after treatments involving trastuzumab and a taxane, and no prior exposure to lapatinib or T-DM1.   Primary endpoints included independently assessed progression free survival (PFS) and safety. PFS was 9.6 months in T-DM1 group vs. 6.4 months in lapatinib plus capecitabine.  Rates of adverse events of grade 3 or higher were greater with lapatinib plus capecitabine.  These results, together with other trials such as TH3RESA indicate promise for T-DM1 therapy in HER2 amplification, and this will be further studied in an arm of the NCI-MATCH trial.	23020162	PubMed		Verma et al., 2012, N.

110	PIK3CA Mutation	307	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Everolimus		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	Archival tumor samples from 549 patients from the BOLERO-1 and -3 trials were analyzed for alterations in the PI3K pathway using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Sanger sequencing. In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PI3K mutations had longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.67 95%CI 0.45 to 1.00, P=0.05) whereas patients with PI3K wild type status did not benefit significantly (HR 1.1, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.46, P=0.5). The same was found when PI3K mutations, PTEN loss and AKT E17K mutations were combinedly analyzed as hyperactive PI3K pathway. Patients with PI3K hyperactive pathway had a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) compared to HR 1.19 (95%CI 0.87 to 1.62, P=0.28) in patients with PI3K normal pathway. These trends were independently confirmed in both trials but only pooled results showed consistent statistical significance.	27091708	PubMed		André et al., 2016, J. Clin.

MMTV-NeuT mice were crossed with floxed p110alpha mice. Diassacociated tumors cells from these mice were treated with Cre adenovirus to delete p110alpha, or GFP adenovirus, and cells were transplanted into athymic mice. GFP treated cells formed new tumors, while p110alpha deletion blocked tumor formation indicating tumor dependence on PI3KA. Next, MMTV-NeuT tumors were dissociated and treated with pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. Reduced lipid kinase activity and reduced phospho-Akt levels were seen in these cells. Administration of 125 mg/kg GDC-0941 to athymic mice with transplantation of tumor cells caused marked reduction of tumor cell volume in comparison to control treatment.	22802530	PubMed		Utermark et al., 2012, Genes Dev.		3	accepted	1380	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1380	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/302	false	breast

The most prominently enriched gene in trastuzumab resistant populations was PTEN. Subsequent knockdown of PTEN in BT-474 cells increased cell survival when treated with trastuzumab, and growth curves showed partial restoration of proliferation in PTEN knockdown BT-474 cells treated with trastuzumab.	17936563	PubMed		Berns et al., 2007, Cancer Cell		2	accepted	1383	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1383	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false	breast

Sequencing of 55 HER2 breast cancer samples revealed 25% PIK3CA mutation rate and Kaplan Meier curves showed decreased time to progression for mutant PIK3CA at borderline statistical significance (p=0.052). This was potentially explained by presence of PTEN loss in wild-type PIK3CA sample and combining PTEN loss with PIK3CA mutation resulted in significant differences in time to progression (p=0.007).	17936563	PubMed		Berns et al., 2007, Cancer Cell		2	accepted	1384	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1384	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/307	false	breast

In contrast, two ER negative cell lines lacking detectable Rb were fully resistant to palbociclib. Knockdown of Rb in 3 of the tested Rb positive cell lines led to moderate palbociclib resistance in short term incubation experiments.  In longer term (15 day) palbociclib incubations of ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and ER positive MCF-7 cells, significant resistance to palbociclib was seen in Rb knockdown conditions while wild-type Rb cells maintained sensitivity.	20473330	PubMed		Dean et al., 2010, Oncogene		3	accepted	1535	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1535	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/602	false	breast

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. MDA-MB-361 is a HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line harboring PIK3CA E545K, and it had an IC50 of 0.14uM. To asses the effect of pictilisib on cell cycle progression and apoptosis, fluorescence based cell cycle and flow cytometry were used to measure the proportion of cells in various phases and the relative presence of Annexin V, a marker of apoptosis. Untreated, 68% of cells were in G1 or sub-G1. Following treatment with 1.0uM pictilisib, the proportion of cells in G1 or sub-G1 rose to 78%, and the amount of Annexin V detected rose 3 fold. A substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT (S473) was also noted. Authors concluded that pictilisib had a modest effect on cell cycle progression and encouraged apoptosis in this cell line, and that this cell line is sensitive to pictilisib. Authors further noted that HER2 amplified cell lines were generally more sensitive, regardless of mutation, to pictilisib than basal-like breast cancer cell lines (p=0.002).	20453058	PubMed		O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin.

Sensitivity and resistance was categorized as less than and more than an IC50 of 1umol/L, respectively, with a maximum tested concentration of 20 umol/L. The authors tested several basal and luminal cell lines harboring PTEN loss for sensitivity to GDC-0941. ZR-75-1, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.15uM and reduction in phosphorylated AKT was noted following administration of GDC-0941. EVSTA-T, a luminal-type cell line, had an IC50 of 0.36uM; treatment resulted in an relative increase of Sub-G and G phase cells from 49% to 78% of total cells evaluated; there was a 12fold increase in annexin V (an apoptotic marker), and a substantial reduction in phosphorylated AKT following GDC-0941 administration. Seven basal-like cell lines harbored PTEN loss and had IC50s ranging fom 0.30uM to 20.00uM (4/7 had IC50s greater than 1 uM). There was a varied reduction in phosphorylated AKT among basal-like cell lines. Authors note that PTEN status may have low predictive power for response, and suggested that other factors such as basal/luminal characteristics may be more informative for GDC-0941 response. Authors further note that luminal type cell lines are generally more sensitive to GDC-0941 than basal type cell lines (p=0.02).	20453058	PubMed		O'Brien et al., 2010, Clin.

Osimertinib failed to induce substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2 in NR6 mouse fibroblast cells transduced to co-express ERBB2 L869R and T798I or ERBB2 wt. AZ5104 blocked phosphorylation to a greater extent in the mutant and wildtype cells. MCF10A cells transduced with ERBB2 wt, ERBB2 T798I alone or ERBB2 L869R and T798I co-expressed did not show substantial reductions in phosphorylated ERBB2, AKT, ERK or S6. AZ5104 induced greater reductions. Authors note that AZ5104 is not being developed independently of osimertinib and only 10% of osimertinib is metabolized into AZ5104 in humans.

Over the next years, she experienced recurrence, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and metastasis -- until her case was presented at a virtual multidisciplinary tumor board organized by the Global Cancer Institute which recommended testing for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 × 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2). The authors note that TERT promoter mutation and a reciprocal inversion including CDKN2A were also identified, but given what is known about LOXO-101 and ETV6-NTRK3, they  infer ETV6-NTRK3 fusion as the primary mitogenic driver in this patient.	29623306	PubMed		Shukla et al., 2017, JCO Precis Oncol		3	accepted	6475	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:38 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6475	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false	breast

Authors found that loss of PTEN expression induced resistance to lapatinib as assessed by colony formation assay compared to PTEN expressing control cells. Among lapatinib treated cells, concentration of phosphorylated AKT and ERK was substantially higher in cells with PTEN loss compared to PTEN expressing cells, by western blot. Furthermore, athymic nude mice injected with PTEN non-expressing BT474 cells had significantly higher mean tumor volume following lapatinib monotherapy compared to mice injected with PTEN expressing BT474.

PTEN loss resulted in partial rescue from the strong dactolisib induced reduction of colony formation that was seen in BT474 cells with unperturbed PTEN. Among cells treated with dactolisib (100nmol/L), those lacking PTEN expression demonstrated higher concentrations of phosphorylated AKT (S473) and phosphorylated ERK compared to PTEN expressing cells.	19010894	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008, Cancer Res.		2	accepted	8276	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8276	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false	breast

Authors found that while PTEN loss induced resistance to lapatinib, combination with dactolisib produced an additive anti-proliferation effect. Western blot analysis of lapatinib and dactolisib combination treated cells showed a decrease in phosphorylated AKT and S6 relative to untreated and lapatinib treated control cells. Authors concluded that addition of dactolisib to lapatinib overcame PTEN loss induced lapatinib resistance in HER-2 positive breast cancer cells.	19010894	PubMed		Eichhorn et al., 2008, Cancer Res.		2	accepted	8278	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8278	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/214	false	breast

IGF1R IHC was performed and patients classified as IGF1R high (n=105) or low (n=50). In IGF1R-high patients, combining metformin with exemestane was associated with significant RFS (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57–2.23 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.73 95% CI 0.56–0.94 for exemestane only, and HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10–1.00 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.02, compared to the sequential treatment arm). There was also significant association with OS (HR for OS 1.72, 95% CI 0.96–3.08 for sequential treatment with metformin, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.03 for exemestane only, and HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.31–1.45 for exemestane with metformin, p = 0.03, compared to the sequential treatment arm).

Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: 'PS1', 'PS3',  'PM5', 'PP1', 'PP4', and 'PP5'.	19472011	PubMed		Calva et al., 2009, Ann. Surg.

There were 116 patients identified for this trial, 51 of which met the conditions to be included. These 51 patients were split into two cohorts: 1) patients that had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR and 2) patients that have previously been treated with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor. In cohort 1, ten of 26 patients had best overall response. Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response, however these ten patients were all partial response. In the same cohort 1, nine had achieved stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 19 patients achieved disease control (73% of total cohort 1, 95% CI 52-88). In cohort 2, of 23 eligible patients, six had a partial response as best overall response and six had stable disease control for at least six months; therefore, 12 patients achieved disease control. (55% of total cohort 2, 95% CI 32-76). The authors conclude that vemurafenib is a potential treatment option for late-stage BRAF V600E-positive papillary thyroid cancer for treatment in patients naïve to a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 1) and to patients that have been previously treated with a multikinase inhibitor (Cohort 2).	27460442	PubMed		Brose et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.

This study found that 107 of the 219 (49%) patients had this mutation signifying that the BRAF V600E mutation is one of the most commonly occurring among PTC patients. This cohort was split into two groups—BRAF+ and BRAF-. Of the 107 patients that were BRAF+, 25% had tumor reoccurrence compared with 9% in the BRAF- group (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis was performed to assess BRAF correlation independent of known contributing factors to cancer such as age, gender, and multifocality. The results showed that the BRAF mutation is indicative/contributes to lymph node metastasis, associated with tumor reoccurrence, stage, and that recurrent disease was more extensive and required more aggressive treatments in BRAF+ patients compared with BRAF- patients. The authors conclude that PTC patients with the BRAF V600E mutation have worse clinicopathological outcomes, and that the BRAF mutation can be used to assess risk stratification in patients with PTC.	16174717	PubMed		Xing et al., 2005, J Clin Endocrinol Metab		4	accepted	9170	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9170	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false	thyroid

Using IHC and custom generated antibody, the overall survival with respect to KIF23 V1 expression was evaluated using the kaplan-meier method with a log rank test. It was found that positive KIF23 V1 staining was correlated with longer overall survival over a period of 5 years (p=.0052). This pattern was seen to a lesser degree over a period of 3 years (p=.1604). KIF23 V1 expression was independent of gender, age, tumor size, or TNM stage (multivariate cox regression).	26674738	PubMed		Sun et al., 2015, BMC Cancer		3	accepted	1745	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:37 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1745	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/681	false	hepatocellular_carcinoma

PIK3CA mutations were identified in the tumors of 84 patients, including 27 with PIK3CA E542K. Authors found a clinical benefit of regorafenib across PIK3CA mutated and wildtype subgroups (progression free survival with regorafenib vs placebo: mutant HR: 0.54, wildtype HR: 0.50, P=0.85). Authors do not provide direct comparison between patients with wildtype and PIK3CA E542K patients.

The authors sought to understand whether the addition of vemurafenib (a BRAF V600E inhibitor) to agents approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer increased therapeutic efficacy, and which combinations worked best. Capecitabine, bevacizumab and vemurafenib combination therapy resulted in 100% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and 190% increased lifespan (ILS) compared to vehicle treated controls. Seven mice experienced partial response and two experienced complete response. Triplet therapy resulted in better TGI and ILS compared to any agent in isolation or capecitabine + vemurafenib doublet therapy (p <0.05, p <0.0001, for all comparisons).	22180495	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012, Cancer Res.		3	accepted	98	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/98	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false	large_intestine
10	BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study examined vemurafenib efficacy on various colorectal cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft experiments. Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).	22180495	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012, Cancer Res.		2	accepted	99	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/99	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false	large_intestine

14	BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic, chemotherapy refractory colorectal cancer. Of those, 30 patients harbored BRAF V600E, were KRAS, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. One patient (who harbored BRAF V600E in low copy number) responded, 11 had stable disease, and 18 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=20), cetuximab monotherapy (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=4), and cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 8 weeks (2-32 weeks), median OS was 25 weeks (4-237 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 61 years old (42-78) and there were 16 males and 14 females. Authors concluded that BRAF mutation (23/24 of mutants were BRAF V600E) was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		3	accepted	126	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:25 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/126	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/12	false	large_intestine

In multivariate analysis of the KRAS wildtype population, significant associations between PIK3CA exon 21 mutations and poor response to cetuximab were retained. The authors concluded that PIK3CA exon 21 mutation status is more predictive of poor response to cetuximab than PIK3CA mutation status as a whole.

PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors, 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 10 mutation was not significantly associated with differences in colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.15 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, Clin.

Break apart FISH assay, which does not distinguish ROS1-fusion partner, was used on the tissue microarray to determine ROS1 fusion status. 2 cases of ROS1 fusions were found. 1 case was verified by RT-PCR to be a SLC34A2-ROS1 fusion, but this case was also positive for BRAF V600E.  The second case of ROS1 fusion was of undetermined fusion partner, where known ROS1 fusion parters SLC34A2, CD74 and SDC4 were tested. This case did not have KRAS or BRAF mutations, indicating that ROS1 fusion may act in a small subset of colorectal cancer as a driver targetable by crizotinib or other inhibitors.	24296758	PubMed		Aisner et al., 2014, Mol.

The variant PPP1R15A (rs557806) showed the most significant association (P = 0.000401) with FOLFIRI-bevacizumab-driven tumor inhibition rate in exome sequencing data and the highest correlation (r = 0.74) with the drug responses in RNA sequencing data. Patients who were homozygous for the reference alleles (GG) of PPP1R15A rs557806 exhibited greater disease control rates and a tendency toward greater overall response rate than those with homozygous or heterozygous substitution alleles (GC and CC; P = 0.027 and 0.073) when treated with bevacizumab-containing regimens. PPP1R15A rs557806 nonsignificantly correlated with DCR in multivariate analysis (P = 0.054).

121	BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Dactolisib,GDC-0879	Combination	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In a mouse model of BRAF V600E colorectal cancer, western blots from tumors in mice treated with BRAF inhibitor GDC-0879 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 showed stronger reduction in phospho-Akt and phospho-S6 than PI3K/mTOR inhibitor alone, and combination inhibition also resulted in stronger phospho-ERK inhibition in tumors than did BRAF inhibition alone. Increased apoptosis in tumors was seen in dual treatment conditions with increased TUNEL-positive cells. In vehicle treated mice, area of colon covered by tumor increased, while treatment with single agent inhibitors caused growth inhibition resulting in no change in colon area covered by tumors. Administration of dual inhibitors induced tumor regression apparent in a decrease of colonic area covered by tumors over the course of treatment.	23549875	PubMed		Coffee et al., 2013, Clin.

Combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition (panitumumab and vemurafenib) showed an initial partial response for 4 months. Re-biopsy at the time of progression showed a MET amplification and overexpression (IHC, ISH) but no secondary mutations in candidate resistance genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, MAP2K1). MET amplification was also present in a subset of tumor cells in the pretreatment sample. MET amplification was also identified in 3/17 (18%) chemonaive BRAF V600E colorectal cancer tumor tissues. Overexpression of MET in a BRAF mutant CRC cell line (WiDr) confered resistance to combined vemurafenib and panitumumab. The addition of crizotinib to this combination restored sensitivity in vitro. The patient was started on combined vemurafenib and crizotinib in January 2016 and had a metabolic, clinical and tumor marker response that was ongoing at the time of publication (06/16) without significant toxicity.	27325282	PubMed		Pietrantonio et al., 2016, Cancer Discov		4	accepted	1588		2023-01-09 21:46:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/1588	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/266	false	large_intestine

All patients received cetuximab after oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidine failure. HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization and correlated with cetuximab efficacy. Of 142 RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors, we observed 7 cases (4.9%) of HER2 amplification by SISH. After a median follow-up of 13.2 months (range, 1.4-78.1 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different according to HER2 status: 3.1 months in patients with HER2 amplification compared with 5.6 months in those with non-amplified HER2 (HR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.18-6.31; P = 0.019).

The effect of panitumumab on PFS in the KRAS wt group was significantly greater than in the KRAS mutant group (HR:0.45, 95% CI:0.34-0.59 vs HR:0.99, 95% CI:0.73-1.36; P<0.0001). None of the 84 panitumumab-treated patients with KRAS mutant tumors responded to treatment (100% positive predictive value for nonresponse in mutant group). In the KRAS wt group treated with panitumumab (n=124), 21 patients had partial response (17%), 42 experienced stable disease (34%). Additionally, patients with KRAS mutations showed no significant improvement between treatment with panitumumab and BSC alone (PFS: 7.4 wk vs 7.3 wk). The authors concluded that their findings support the hypothesis that KRAS mutations confer primary resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies and recommend that KRAS status be evaluated prior to panitumumab administration.	18316791	PubMed		Amado et al., 2008, J.

Patients harboring BRAF mutations (total n=24, V600E n=23, D594G n=1) had a lower response rate than did patients with wildtype BRAF (n=326; 2/24 [4.3%] vs 124/326 [38%], OR: 0.15, p=0.0012). BRAF mutant patients also experienced significantly lower disease control rate, PFS, and OS (median 26 vs 54 weeks, HR: 3.03 p<0.0001) in response to cetuximab treatment. In multivariate analysis, the significant associations between BRAF mutations and poor outcome were confirmed. The authors noted that two responders had the following genotypes: V600E mutation in low copy number, and BRAF D594G, and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		3	accepted	2187	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2187	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/395	false	large_intestine

Patients with KRAS wildtype, NRAS assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=301) were genotyped for NRAS mutations. Patients harboring NRAS mutant tumors (n=13) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype NRAS (n=289; 1/13 [7.7%] vs 110/289 [77.9%]; p =.013). However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment. Authors suggest screening for mutations in the following gene order: KRAS, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA exon 21 (listed as PIK3CA exon 20 in the source).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		2	accepted	2210	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:30 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/2210	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/208	false	large_intestine

Of the patients with metastatic CRC that underwent NGS testing, 208 patients had non-V600 BRAF mutations (22% of BRAF mutations identified and 2.2% of total patients tested ). When compared to V600 BRAF mutations, tumors without V600 BRAF mutations were more prevalent in younger patients (58 v 68 years, respectively) and male patients (65% vs 46%, respectively). Additionally, non-V600 BRAF mutations were less prevalent in high-grade tumors (13% v 64%, respectively) and right-sided primary tumors (36% v 81%, respectively). Median overall survival was significantly longer in patients with non-V600 BRAF-mutant metastatic CRC compared with those with both V600E BRAF-mutant and wild-type BRAF metastatic CRC (60.7 v 11.4 v 43.0 months).	28486044	PubMed		Jones et al., 2017, J.

Patients with KRAS mutant tumors (total [n = 253], codon 12 [n=183], 13 [n=47], 59 [n=1], 61 [n=13], 146 [n=9]) had a significantly lower response rate (17/253; 6.7%) compared to patients with KRAS wt tumors (126/352; 35.8%; OR: .13; P < .0001). Patients with KRAS mutant tumors also experienced significant lower disease control rate, shorter median progression free survival and overall survival. Association between KRAS mutation status and outcome was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Authors note that these patients were treated with cetuximab prior to widespread adoption of regular KRAS mutational status screening. Patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab monotherapy were not included.	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		4	accepted	3704	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3704	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/332	false	large_intestine

237	PIK3CA Exon 21 Mutation	105	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	This study analyzed tumor and patient characteristics from 1,170 colorectal cancer patients derived from the prospective cohort studies: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutations, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21 (listed as exon 20 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 21 mutation was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.11 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, Clin.

Patients with KRAS wildtype, PIK3CA assessable tumors, and individual response data (n=339) were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Patients harboring PIK3CA mutant tumors (n=34) had a significantly lower response rate than did patients with wildtype PIK3CA (6/34 [17.7%] vs 115/305 [37.7%]; p =.015). Patients with mutant PIK3CA also experienced lower disease control rate in response to cetuximab treatment. However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype PIK3CA in progression free or overall survival (median PFS: 18 vs 24 weeks; median OS: 39 vs 51 weeks). Authors suggest that PIK3CA exon 21 mutations are more relevant to cetuximab response than PIK3CA mutations as a whole, as PIK3CA exon 10 mutations do not appear to effect cetuximab response (exons are listed as exon 20 and exon 9 in the source).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		2	accepted	3732	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:32 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3732	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/307	false	large_intestine

256	KRAS G13D	81	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	This was a retrospective study of 691 cetuximab treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Of those, 50 patients harbored KRAS G13D, were BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA wt, and had individual response data. Nine patients had partial response, 19 had stable disease, and 22 progressed. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=38), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=5), cetuximab monotherapy (n=4), cetuximab + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=2), and cetuximab + irinotecan + oxaliplatin + 5FU (n=1). Median PFS was 16 weeks (3-101 weeks), median OS was 33 weeks (3-161 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 65 years old (34-78), and there were 29 males and 20 females. Authors concluded that KRAS mutation was strongly associated with poor response to cetuximab and suggested that mutation status of KRAS is the most informative compared to BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response.	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		3	accepted	3881	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3881	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/81	false	large_intestine

Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, KRAS G12C expressing SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth. Mice injected with KRAS wt cells did not significantly respond to regorafenib, although a trend was seen toward better response. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed no significant change in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31) and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS G12C expressing mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS wt expressing mice whose tumors displayed more pronounced changes. Authors concluded that G12C was more resistant to regorafenib than KRAS wt and other common KRAS G12/G13 mutants.	26161928	PubMed		Camaj et al., 2015, Future Oncol		2	accepted	3973	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:27 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/3973	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/78	false	large_intestine

290	PIK3CA Exon 10 and Exon 21 Mutation	1867	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This was a prospective study involving 1,170 colorectal cancer patients confirmed by histology. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of cased via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples, of these 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21, and 3.7% (7/189) had mutations in both exons. Study found that exon 10 + exon 21 mutants were associated with shorter cancer specific survival and overall survival when compared to WT PIK3CA (P = 0.031, P = 0.0008). These mutants were also associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51, multivariate HR 2.68). In contrast, mutations on either exon 10 or exon 21 alone were not statistically significant in terms of overall survival. Note that exons 10 and 21 are listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1. Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, Clin.

325	PIK3CA Mutation	307	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Aspirin		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	This was a retrospective study of 964 colorectal cancer patients who participated in the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803)  and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.	23094721	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, N. Engl. J.

328	EGFR V441F	2486	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab,Panitumumab	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	E	Resistance	Next-generation sequencing data of cfDNA from 1,397 patients with colorectal cancer identified a novel cluster of extracellular domain (ECD). EGFR V441G/D/F mutations were found in 19% (n=8) of patients with EGFR ECD domain III (location of cetuximab and panitumumab binding epitope) mutations. V441D and V441G were more common than V441F. Resistance of V441G to cetuximab was modeled in silico, and authors predicted that it destroys a critical hydrophobic node. In vitro, V441G/D transduced NIH3T3 cells had significantly reduced binding to panitumumab and cetuximab compared to EGFR wt NH3T3 cells (p<0.01 for all comparisons to wt). Authors inferred that EGFR domain III (ECD) mutations, including V441F, may be responsible for secondary resistance to EGFR blockade.	29196463	PubMed		Strickler et al., 2018, Cancer Discov		2	accepted	7096	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:47:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7096	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2486	false	large_intestine
329	BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	Patients with completely resected colorectal adenocarcinoma (Stage II-III) were treated with fluorouracil and leucovorin +/- ironotecan. Of the 1,307 FFPE samples tested, V600E was observed in 31 Stage II samples (7.6%) and 72 Stage III samples (7.9%). V600E was prognostic for overall survival, but not for relapse-free survival, in patients with stages II and III combined, and in stage III alone. For all MSI low and stable tumors, BRAF V600E positive samples had a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.19 (95% CI, 1.43 to 3.37, P=0.00034). For all samples in the cohort (MSI-H and MSI-L) BRAF V600E positive samples had a 1.66 HR (95% CI, 1.15 to 2.40, P=0.0069). The authors note prognostic value for BRAF V600E, especially in non-MSI high tumors.	20008640	PubMed		Roth et al., 2010, J. Clin.

BRAF mutation status (V600E) was analyzed via LightMix BRAF V600E Kit. V600E mutations were detected in 60/999 tumor samples (6%), 59 of which were wild-type for KRAS. When comparing patients with wildtype KRAS (n=625), BRAF V600E tumors had worse outcomes relative to BRAF wildtype. For patients with BRAF V600E tumors (n=566), median overall survival (OS) was 25.1 months with cetuximab and 21.6 months without cetuximab. For patients with wildtype BRAF (n=59), median OS was 14.1 months with cetuximab and 10.3 months without cetuximab.	21502544	PubMed		Van Cutsem et al., 2011, J. Clin.

When evaluating 14 studies (n = 7778 patients), the odds ratio (OR) of a proximal lesion, which is associated with greater mortality in colon cancer, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 5.222, 95% CI 3.801–7.174, P < 0.001). When evaluating 4 studies (n = 1526 patients), the odds ratio of T4 tumors, which indicates tumor growth past bowel lining, was increased for patients with BRAF mutations (OR 1.761, 95% CI 1.164–2.663, P = 0.007). When evaluating 8 studies (n = 2786 patients), the odds ratio of poor tumor differentiation was increased in patients with BRAF mutations (OR 3.816, 95% CI 2.714–5.365, P < 0.001). These results support that BRAF mutations indicate poor prognosis for patients with colorectal cancer.	24112392	PubMed		Clancy et al., 2013, Colorectal Dis		4	accepted	7159	Somatic	2023-01-09 21:46:33 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7159	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/395	false	large_intestine
333	PIK3CA Exon 10 or Exon 21 Mutation	3179	Rectum Cancer	1993	Neoplasm of the rectum			Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study examined outcomes of 240 rectum cancer patients treated with total mesorectal excision therapy. Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA mutations in exons 10 and 21 (listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common to exclude non-coding exon 1). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 19 cases (12 in exon 10 and 7 in exon 21). PIK3CA mutations were associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of recurrence of rectal tumors (5-year risk: 27.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.008). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations experienced a shorter time to recurrence compared to those with WT PIK3CA (median: 7.9 vs 19.6 months, p = 0.07). Patients with concomitant PIK3CA and KRAS mutations had a similar local reoccurrence rate to patients with PIK3CA mutations only. In multivariate analysis, PIK3A mutation was an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (HR: 3.4, P =0.017).	19903786	PubMed		He et al., 2009, Clin.

Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth, although KRAS wt mice trended toward better response than KRAS G12C expressing mice. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed more pronounced changes in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS wt mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS G12C mice whose tumors did not display changes in these markers.

351	KRAS G10_A11insG	3209	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Oncogenic	Supports	D	Oncogenicity	FFPE tumor tissue from 1506 colorectal cancer patients was analyzed at codons 12, 13, 61 and 146 by PCR. 672 KRAS mutations were found in 670 patients, and from these, two were inframe insertions located near codon 12. G10_A11insG was validated by direct sequencing. G10_A11insG, G12V and wildtype KRAS were transfected into 293FT and NIH3T3 cells. Increased p-ERK and GTP-bound RAS was seen with G10_A11insG and G12V, but not wildtype. Significantly increased colony formation, and larger tumor size of NIH3T3 cells injected into nude mice was seen with G10_A11insG and G12V over wildtype cells. Enhanced signaling, clonogenicity, and growth suggest G10_A11insG promotes oncogenic transformation in these cell types.	24642870	PubMed		Tong et al., 2014, Cancer Biol Ther		4	accepted	9330	Somatic	2023-02-21 18:45:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9330	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3209	false	large_intestine

353	KDR R1032Q	3218	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Lenvatinib,Axitinib,Cabozantinib,Dovitinib	Substitutes	Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	R1032Q affects the gene's universal kinase catalytic motif. The authors found that injection of mice with COLO-320 cells that harbor this mutation resulted in tumor generation, indicating that this mutation could have oncogenic potential. In vitro kinase assays showed R1032Q reduced VEGFR2 kinase activity. Using proliferation studies with the COLO-320 cell-line, the authors observed sensitivity to 4 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment of the MDST8 colorectal cancer cell line carrying the R1032Q mutation with cabozantinib resulted in significant reduction in cell growth and increased ERK phosphorylation levels.	29588308	PubMed		Toledo et al., 2018, Clin Cancer Res		2	accepted	9339	Unknown	2023-01-09 21:47:08 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9339	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3218	false	large_intestine
354	BRAF V600E	12	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Cetuximab,Encorafenib	Combination	Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	The open-label phase 3 BEACON CRC trial included 665 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic CRC. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab (triplet-therapy group); encorafenib and cetuximab (doublet-therapy group); or the investigators’ choice of either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI. The median overall survival was 8.4 months (95% CI, 7.5 to 11.0) in the doublet-therapy group and 5.4 months (95% CI, 4.8 to 6.6) in the control group, with a significantly lower risk of death compared to the control group (hazard ratio for death doublet-group vs. control, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.79; P<0.001). The confirmed response rate was 26% (95% CI, 18 to 35) in the triplet-therapy group, 20% in the doublet-therapy group (95% CI 13 to 29) and 2% (95% CI, 0 to 7) in the control group (doublet group vs. control P<0.001). Median PFS was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) in the doublet-therapy group, and 1.5 months (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.7) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression doublet-group vs control, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52, P<0.001).	31566309	PubMed		Kopetz et al., 2019, N.

360	EGFR Amplification AND EGFR EGFR::SEPT14	4175	Colon Adenocarcinoma	234		Erlotinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	Case report describing a 63-year-old patient with colorectal adenocarcinoma. He started treatment with XELOX and bevacizumab. After findings of disease progression, they changed to bevacizumab and FOLFIRI. They detected EGFR::SEPT14 fusion (exon 24 & exon 10) and EGFR amplification by NGS on a paraffin sample after discontinuing the treatment due to complications. The tumor was microsatellite stable. The patient started treatment with erlotinib with signs of partial response (CT scan) 20 days later. A couple months later the patient showed signs of progressive disease, but a new variant, EGFRvIII (deletion of Exons 2-7), was detected in the mediastinal lymph nodes sample tested that likely contributed to erolotinib resistance.	32162810	PubMed		Li et al., 2020, Oncologist		2	accepted	10913	Somatic	2023-02-23 21:12:31 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10913	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/4175	false	large_intestine
