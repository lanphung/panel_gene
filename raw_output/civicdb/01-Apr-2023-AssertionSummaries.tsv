Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 5 to 10% of AML is associated with activating point mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), particularly at the D835 residue. FLT3 D835 mutations are a common mechanism of clinical resistance to type II FLT3 inhibitors (sorafenib, quizartinib and ponatinib), which bind only the inactive kinase conformation. However, gilteritinib, a type I oral inhibitor of FLT3 and AXL, demonstrated preclinical activity against type II FLT3 inhibitor resistance-conferring D835 mutations and clinical activity as monotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) FLT3-mutated AML in multiple clinical trials. The 2017 FDA approved FLT3 mutation companion diagnostic assay can detect a D835 or I836 mutation, but cannot distinguish which of these residues is mutated.

The TRK pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK fusions being the best characterized. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are NTRK inhibitors that are FDA approved for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including tumors with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, and are reported to have durable NTRK inhibition. Evaluating response of ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in B-ALL cases to larotrectinib is difficult due to the rarity of the fusion in this cancer type. However, in a limited number of clinical cases of ETV6-NTRK3 in B-ALL, patients harboring these fusions have responded to larotrectinib. One patient demonstrated a response to treatment that was lost on discontinuation of therapy but showed durable response achieving remission on restarting laroterctinib [civic:eid8917]. The functional impact of ETV6-NTRK3 has been demonstrated through increased tumorigenic properties in mice, which mimic human B-ALL [civic:eid8931] and enhanced sensitivity to Larotrectinib both in vivo and in vitro [civic:eid6930]. These pre-clinical and limited clinical studies show that ETV6-NTRK3 fusion-positive B-ALL may demonstrate response to larotrectinib with minimal adverse effects similar to solid tumors for which these are FDA-approved.	39	7993,6099,8931,6930,7496,8930,8917	2023-01-09 21:47:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/39	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7993,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6099,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8931,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6930,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7496,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8930,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8917	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/39	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/779	false

ABL1 SNX2::ABL1	2547	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma, BCR-ABL1–like	0080650			Diagnostic	Supports	Positive		Tier II - Level C					SNX2-ABL1 fusions are associated with Ph-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia	SNX2-ABL1 fusions in B-ALL are rare based on large retrospective studies. Few cases have been described but when available, microarray expression signatures from patients harboring these fusions, show a Ph-like signature. Co-occurrence with IKZF1 deletions has been described in 2 patients. Relatively short overall survival has also been implied in these rare patients, consistent with the poor outcomes associated with Ph-like B-ALL.	43	7254,7241,7744,9178,9177,7694	2023-01-09 21:47:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/43	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7254,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7241,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7744,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9178,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9177,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7694	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/43	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/2547	false

Larotrectinib has been approved by the FDA to treat NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors (Tier I, level A). Two KANK1::NTRK2 fusion-positive central nervous system tumors in two different individuals demonstrated response to adjuvant larotrectinib treatment. In both reports, NTRK2 was the 3' partner, in-frame, and had the tyrosine kinase domain retained.	51	10360,10392,10361	2023-01-09 21:47:55 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/51	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10360,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10392,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10361	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/51	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3027	false
NTRK2 KANK1::NTRK2	3027	Solid Tumor				Oncogenic	Supports	Oncogenic							KANK1::NTRK2 is classified as an Oncogenic NTRK fusion.	KANK1::NTRK2 has been reported in five published tumors, (CA1), including in 4 brain tumors, with NTRK2 the 3’ partner gene in each case (FG1). Additionally, the fusion junctions reported are predicted to retain an intact NTRK2 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) (FG2) and the TKD to be in-frame (FG3). KANK1 has been reported as a 5’ fusion partner in other kinase gene fusions in cancers (CA2). In two of the five reported cases, KANK1::NTRK2 positive tumors demonstrated response to NTRK targeted (larotrectinib) treatment (CV). Expression of the fusion has been detected by Pan-Trk immunohistochemical staining (FS2). Collectively, FG1+FG2+FG3+CA1+CA2+CV+FS2, results in an Oncogenic classification for KANK1::NTRK2 via the ClinGen NTRK SC-VCEP fusion oncogenicity rules.	57	10896,10360,10362,10361,8653	2023-01-13 07:39:03 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/57	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10896,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10360,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10362,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/10361,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8653	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/57	https://civicdb.org/links/molecular_profiles/3027	false
